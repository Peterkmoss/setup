# Contributing

If you have additional info, a problem you ran into or anything you think would fit the repository, feel free to create an issue or a pull request.

Translations to other languages and grammar checks are very welcome as well!

There are templates located in the `templates` folder in the root of the project, so you know what to include.

If you have issues with code specific terms when linting you can add words to `lintconfig/Vocab/Code/accept.txt`, separated by a newline, for the linter to accept the terms.

To lint without having to push and have it run on a PR, install [Vale](/docs/tools/linters/vale/vale_en.md#installing)

If something is not applicable to the guide feel free to delete it from the final guide, but include why it's not needed in your PR.
